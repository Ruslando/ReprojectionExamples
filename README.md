Temporal Reprojection Example
=============================

This project combines Keijiros "Temporal Reprojection", as well as Comrade Stingers "Async Reprojection" Unity Demo
to provide timewarp and spacewarp rerojection techniques as post-process shader.

It supports two optimization modes for latency reduction and frame extrapolation
and has orientation timewarp, positional timewarp and spacewarp as possible reprojection methods.
